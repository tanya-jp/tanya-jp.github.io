I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at McMaster University, specializing in Evolutionary Computing and Genetic Programming. Under the guidance of [Dr. Kelly](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/cas/faculty/dr-stephen-kelly/), I work as a research assistant, where I am investigating the potential of Tangled Program Graphs (TPG) as a novel memory mechanism for enhancing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. My goal is to contribute to the development of more robust and efficient AI models that can learn and adapt in dynamic environments.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), where I cultivated a strong foundation in Software Engineering and Machine Learning. My undergraduate thesis focused on the challenging field of Underwater Image Processing, where I developed a software system that significantly improves image clarity from aquatic environments. 
<!-- The open-source portion of this project is available [here](https://uw-images.streamlit.app/). -->

As I continue my journey in computer science, I am eager to collaborate with peers and industry leaders to drive innovation and make a positive impact on society through technology.
