I recently completed my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at McMaster University, where I specialized in Evolutionary Computing and Genetic Programming. Now I am continuing my journey with McMaster as a Research Assistant, exploring Neuroscience and Speech Processing to learn something new that remains connected in many ways.

Still, I remain connected to Evolutionary Computing. During my graduate studies, I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Stephen Kelly](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/cas/faculty/dr-stephen-kelly/) at the [Creative Algorithms Lab](https://creativealgorithms-cd4c88.gitlab.io/team/), where I investigated Tangled Program Graphs (TPGs) with novel memory mechanisms to enhance Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems. This is a project I continue to contribute to.

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Christian Brodbeck](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/cas/faculty/christian-brodbeck/) to study how people use linguistic context to interpret speech, especially when the signal is unclear due to noise or hearing loss. Our research aims to model how this process unfolds during continuous speech, how it changes with age, and how it is affected by hearing loss. We collect EEG, fMRI, and cognitive and hearing assessment data to support these models. More details about this project can be found [HERE](https://christianbrodbeck.net/projects/context-use/).

I am always excited to connect with others who are passionate about using technology to drive innovation and create meaningful impact.
